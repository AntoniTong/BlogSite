**Bio.** I am a research scientist at UC San Diego, currently working on implementing machine learning, control and optimization for energy storage systems in congestion with smart grid, renewable generation and electrified transportation. I am the principle investigator for the ARPAe CHARGES program, testing and valuating new battery technologies for the grid, bridging the gaps between battery innovation and commercialization. I received my PhD from the University of California Davis, where I worked on lithium-ion battery modeling and estimation, battery thermal management design and fuel cell flow field optimization. Together with members in the green transportation lab, I designed and developped two solar plus storage energy projects: the AGGIE Village Smart Home and a Nano-Grid at the Robert Mondavi Institution, notably using repurposed electric vehicle batteries as for stationary energy storage systems. I received my BSc in mechatronics engineering from Zhejiang University, in Hangzhou China. [Resume](../../files/cv.pdf)
